Nowadays, Blogs have become a very important part of life where we can share our knowledge and thoughts through blogs.
This project is basically a blogging website where users can publish blogs on their own interest and can share information and their knowledge through their blogs.
We have created a blogging website (Blog Master) Through which every user can read and write blogs.
This website is a blogging website where it requires an authentication register and login for every user. 
For those users who have logged in can see blogs which are written by all users. 
Navbar changes for the user who is logged in or not logged in. 
The users who have not logged in can not see blogs written by all users.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
This project has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) blog options for user 
and also bookmark the blogs which the user wish to read later and like the blogs which they enjoyed reading.
